Navigating the DOM with jQuery

CSS offers quite a bit of power when it comes to selecting items. However, there are a couple of limitations. First, CSS selectors aren't dynamic; if new items are added later those new items aren't part of the selection. Second, there are times when it's just easier to express the items you want programatically rather than using CSS. Fortunately, jQuery allows us to select items by using code as well.
