Because you've already download the file, it's easy to simply ensure it's part of your project, deployed to your server, and then referenced in a page.this is yet another file that your server has to send to the user, which increases both the number of requests the server needs to handle and the amount of bandwidth required for the server to serve a page to a user. -->
